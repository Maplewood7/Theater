### User Story 🗣️

<div align="justify">
In our theater, each project involves many people, spaces, and schedules—from technical and stage crews to artistic teams. All of this requires perfect coordination and tracking, which can sometimes become chaotic. That’s why we need an application that allows us to have everything in one place.

With it, we could easily assign workers to tasks, reserve spaces as needed, and track rehearsal and performance schedules. This way, everyone would have a clear overview and up-to-date information, bringing more order and less stress to our projects.
