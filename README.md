### User Story 🗣️

<div align="justify">
As a hotel manager, I want to organize guest information and hotel operations into
categories and subcategories so that we can efficiently manage our services and
enhance the guest experience. For example, I want to group information under main
categories like "Reservations" or "Guest Services," and break them down further, such
as "VIP Guests" under "Reservations" or "Room Maintenance" under "Housekeeping."  

I’d like to view these categories in a tree-like structure where staff can easily
expand or collapse sections. I want to be able to add, rename, move, or delete
categories with ease and assign colors or icons to them for quick identification.
Additionally, I want to link guest preferences to their profiles to ensure that all
staff members have access to relevant information.

The ability to search, filter, and sort through information is crucial, as well as 
organizing templates for common requests that automatically create subcategories.
When generating reports or analyzing data, I want the structure to be preserved.

In short, this system will help us manage our hotel operations efficiently, making
it easier to provide exceptional service to our guests.
