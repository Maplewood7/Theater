<div align="justify">
Each user has their own account, which contains notes and notifications that can be 
customized according to their needs. Notes and notifications can have a many-to-many 
relationship, meaning one notification can be linked to multiple notes and vice versa.
Additionally, users can share a specific combination of notes and notifications with 
other users.

Users are also able to organize content into different categories, such as "School," 
"Work," "Personal," and more, to manage their information more easily. These categories
can be organized in a tree-like pattern, allowing for subcategories under main categories.
For example, users can organize "School" by different subjects such as "Math," 
"Science," or "History," and "Work" by project names or specific tasks, creating 
a structured hierarchy for better management of their information.

There is a planned implementation of customization features for the visual interface, 
such as adjusting colors to the user's preference, changing fonts, and, with 
sufficient resources, the addition of basic themes for the interface's appearance.
For instance, users could choose between rounded and angular design elements.

The user logs into their account (or creates one). A selection of templates is 
offered upon login. If the user does not choose a template, they are taken to an 
empty template predefined in the application. The user can print the created file, 
save it as a PDF, or share it with others.

The main screen is divided into sections for paragraphs, pages, and an editor. 
The user can view all created 
paragraphs, search through them, and delete them.
In the editor, all basic text manipulation functions are enabled, including font 
formatting, lists, styles, and syntax checking. It is possible to add tables, 
files, images, links, symbols, emoticons, and audio.
